"""
Resolve OGC Building Block schemas into a single complete JSON Schema.

Recursively resolves ALL $ref references from the modular YAML/JSON source
schemas into one fully-inlined schema — purely for validation and inspection,
with no form simplifications.

$ref patterns handled:
  1. Relative path:       $ref: ../cdifCatalogRecord/schema.yaml
  2. Fragment-only:       $ref: '#/$defs/Identifier'
  3. Cross-file fragment: $ref: ../cdifCatalogRecord/schema.yaml#/$defs/conformsTo_item
  4. URL ref:             $ref: https://usgin.github.io/metadataBuildingBlocks/_sources/.../schema.yaml
  5. Protocol-relative:   $ref: //usgin.github.io/metadataBuildingBlocks/_sources/.../schema.yaml
  6. Both YAML and JSON file extensions

Usage:
    python tools/resolve_schema.py adaEPMA           # writes resolvedSchema.json in place
    python tools/resolve_schema.py CDIFDiscoveryProfile
    python tools/resolve_schema.py --file path/to/any/schema.yaml
    python tools/resolve_schema.py adaEPMA -o elsewhere.json
    python tools/resolve_schema.py adaEPMA --stdout   # print instead of writing
    python tools/resolve_schema.py --all

Writing is the default. It used to be printing, which meant the obvious
invocation resolved the schema, reported its size, and left the
resolvedSchema.json beside the source untouched -- so a change to
schema.yaml could land in the source and in nothing that validates
against it. `--all` wrote in place, so the tool had two opposite
behaviours and the silent one was the default. Use `--stdout` for the
old behaviour.

`--all` covers every block with external $refs *or* an existing
resolvedSchema.json, and reports how many it actually changed.
